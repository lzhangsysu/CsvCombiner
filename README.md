# PMG Programming Challenges

# CSV Combiner

This is a command line program that takes several CSV files as arguments. Each CSV
file (found in the `fixtures` directory of this repo) has the same
columns. The program outputs a new CSV file to `stdout` that contains the
rows from each of the inputs along with an additional column that has the
filename from which the row came (only the file's basename, not the entire path).
`filename` is used as the header for the additional column.

## Example
This example is provided to illustrate how the program runs:

```
$ java CsvCombiner ./fixtures/accessories.csv ./fixtures/clothing.csv > combined.csv
```

Given two input files named `clothing.csv` and `accessories.csv`:
